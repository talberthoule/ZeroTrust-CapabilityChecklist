# ZeroTrust-CapabilityChecklist

Many clients over the years have been diving in to Zero Trust implementations to one degree or another. One of the tools I came across that was helpful to me was the Department of Defense (DoD) Zero Trust Capability Execution Roadmap.  

When I first saw it, the document was a thing of beauty.  Having all the controls, descriptions, outcomes, estimated durations, and other useful information helped me round out what CISA and others have proposed, but in a much more comprehensive format.  

What I am offering up is a structured data version of that, which I have made slights adjustments to eliminate Federal Government specific language and other small enhancements to give greater context to the information presented.  

Check out the link in the description if you want to get access to the checklist of safeguards, mapped to Pillars, Functions, and Capabilities.  

• Each pillar provides a foundational component of the overall Zero Trust security model, with its own set of functions, capabilities, and safeguards.
• CISA Function Mapping - Describes maturity levels for different security domains (e.g., "Identity Stores" progressing from self-managed to fully integrated)
• Capability - Names a specific security control or feature needed (e.g., "Conditional User Access")
• Safeguard - Details the implementation steps to establish that capability (e.g., "Roles and Permissions Pt1")
